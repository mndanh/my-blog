# My Blog

for this assignment I had to create a blog page that a user could enter their username, title, and content of their blog into page 1. It would save to local storage and be displayed in order on a secondary blog page where you can see all your previous blogs. there is a back button to go to the first page again and write more blog posts. There is also a toggle button that lets you choose between light and dark mode.
